I am Dhwani Patel and I am majoring in Accounting with a concentration in Finance and Computer Science as my minor. 
I've enjoyed coding since high school and hence wanted to incorporate it in some way during college. I have previously worked on coding a 2048 game at a very 
basic level and also developed an Android app for a capstone project which helped students book appointments with the Tutors at the VSC in a much easier way.
I wish to work with data analysis, ERDs, etc. where I can apply the knowledge from my business classes and be able to explore more about Git, Android Studio,
or even a new platform to work on projects.
